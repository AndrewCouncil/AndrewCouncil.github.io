**My first post!** I've been meaning to set up a little personal blog for a while, and I have finally had the time to do it.

My primary motivation is to have a better option than GitHub Gists to pass around guides and resources. However, I'm hoping this will also be a good place for me to share what I'm up to regarding my personal projects and discuss new technologies I come across.

In keeping with this theme, I figured I'd document the process of getting this site operational.
