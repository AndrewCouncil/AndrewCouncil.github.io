Hi! I'm Drew, also known as [@bizmyth](/about).

I'm an NYC-based software engineer working at [Dirac, Inc](https://www.diracinc.com/).

I love **backend and infrastructure**. I program a lot in **Go, Python, and C/C++**.

I'm also a big fan of **Nix and NixOS**. Check out [my NixOS config](https://github.com/AndrewCouncil/nixconf)!

I occassionally write about technologies and topics that interest me here.
